## Code Explanation
### HTML
- The HTML structure includes sections for the **navbar**, **home**, **categories**, **sign-in**, and **footer**.
- Each section is wrapped in semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).

### CSS
- Custom CSS styles enhance the appearance, including transitions, hover effects, and layout adjustments.
- Classes like `.navbar`, `.cards-row`, and `.form-container` manage the responsive layout.

### Bootstrap Integration
- **Navbar**: Bootstrap classes like `navbar`, `navbar-expand-lg`, and `navbar-toggler` are used for a responsive navigation bar.
- **Cards**: Product categories use Bootstrap's card components for layout.
- **Forms**: The sign-in form uses Bootstrap's grid and form classes for alignment and styling.
